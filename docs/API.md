# Flo API Documentation

## Base URL

**Local:** `http://flo.local:3001` or `http://<local-ip>:3001`

The standalone Server App listens on `http://<local-ip>:3003` and forwards
these protected routes to the local API. Its customer-creation forwarder is
limited to 150 requests per minute per client IP, including LAN/private IPs.
The `POST /api/printers/print-kot` and `POST /api/printers/print-bill`
forwarders share a limit of 30 requests per minute per client IP. These limits
run before Server App authentication and return HTTP `429` when exceeded.

## Authentication

### POST `/api/auth/login`
Authenticate user and receive JWT token.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "chef1@flo.local",
  "password": "chef123"
}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "user": {
    "id": "chef-1",
    "name": "Chef One",
    "email": "chef1@flo.local",
    "role": "chef",
    "category_ids": ["cat-1", "cat-2"]
  }
}
```

**Error (401):**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid credentials"
}
```

### POST `/api/auth/password/change`
Change the authenticated user's password.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "current_password": "chef123",
  "password": "NewChef123"
}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "message": "Password changed successfully"
}
```

Incorrect current-password attempts return `400` with `attempts_remaining`. After five incorrect attempts for the same user, password-change attempts for that user are locked for five minutes; the fifth response reports `attempts_remaining: 0` and `lockout_minutes: 5`. Further attempts during the lockout return `429`. A valid current password or an expired lockout resets the per-user failed-attempt counter. This endpoint also uses the LAN-aware authentication rate limiter.

{
  "orders": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "order_number": "ORD-001",
      "type": "dine_in",
      "status": "pending",
      "table": { "id": "table-1", "name": "T1" },
      "items": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "product_name": "Cheeseburger",
          "quantity": 2,
          "status": "pending",
          "addons": [{ "id": "addon-1", "name": "Extra Cheese", "price": 20, "quantity": 1 }],
          "special_instructions": "No onions"
        }
      ],
      "created_at": "2025-03-31T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### POST `/api/orders`
Create new order.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Order item `addons` reference catalog add-ons by `id`. Each add-on must be active and linked to the product's add-on group. Add-on name and price are resolved from the catalog (client-supplied names and prices are ignored). Quantity defaults to `1` when omitted and must be a positive integer. `service_charge` is an optional explicit non-negative per-order amount validated and persisted by the server; omitted/null means `0`. Settings' service-charge category selects tax treatment only - it does not define an amount or rate, and no automatic service charge is applied.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "type": "dine_in",
  "table_id": "table-1",
  "customer_id": "cust-1",
  "service_charge": 0,
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": "prod-1",
      "quantity": 2,
      "addons": [{ "id": "addon-1", "quantity": 1 }],
      "special_instructions": "No onions"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "order": { ... },
  "bill": { ... }
}
```

---

### GET `/api/orders/:id`
Get order details.

---

### PATCH `/api/orders/:id/status`
Update order status.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "status": "preparing"
}
```

**Valid transitions:**

| Current status | Allowed next statuses |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| `pending` | `preparing`, `ready`, `served`, `completed`, `cancelled` |
| `preparing` | `ready`, `served`, `completed`, `cancelled` |
| `ready` | `served`, `completed`, `cancelled` |
| `served` | `completed`, `cancelled` |
| `completed` | none (terminal) |
| `cancelled` | none (terminal) |

Repeating a request for the order's current status is an idempotent no-op.
Cancelling an order requires a manager PIN when the order has progressed beyond
`pending` or any item is already in progress. Cancellation restores inventory
only for non-terminal items that recorded an inventory deduction; cancelled,
voided, and accounting-adjustment items are excluded.

---

## Held Orders

### GET `/api/held-orders`
List held orders. Requires an authenticated owner, manager, cashier, or server.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "id": "ho-abc12345",
      "tableId": "table-1",
      "items": [
        {
          "id": "line-1",
          "product": { "id": "prod-1", "name": "Cheeseburger", "price": 250 },
          "quantity": 1,
          "addons": [],
          "special_instructions": ""
        }
      ],
      "customerId": null,
      "guestCount": 1,
      "orderNotes": "",
      "heldAt": "2025-03-31T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "skippedCount": 0
}
```

### POST `/api/held-orders`
Create or replace the held order for a table. The response `id` identifies the
specific row returned to the client; replacing an existing held order creates a
new identity. Requires an authenticated owner, manager, cashier, or server.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "tableId": "table-1",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "line-1",
      "product": { "id": "prod-1", "name": "Cheeseburger", "price": 250 },
      "quantity": 1,
      "addons": [],
      "special_instructions": ""
    }
  ],
  "customerId": null,
  "guestCount": 1,
  "orderNotes": ""
}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "ho-abc12345"
}
```

### DELETE `/api/held-orders/:tableId?heldOrderId=:id`
Consume the held order only when `heldOrderId` matches the current row. A
matching request deletes the row, releases the table, and returns
`{"success":true,"deleted":true}`. Requests without an identity, for an
already-consumed row, or for a replacement row return
`{"success":true,"deleted":false}` without deleting the current row or
releasing the table. Requires an authenticated owner, manager, cashier, or
server.

---

## Order Items

### PATCH `/api/orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/cancel`
Cancel an order item.

- A cancellable item outside `preparing` or `ready` becomes `cancelled` and
  restores its recorded inventory deduction.
- An item in `preparing` or `ready` becomes `voided`, adds a negative
  `void_adjustment` bill line, and does not restore inventory; a manager PIN is
  required for the void.
- A new cancellation on a completed, cancelled, paid, or partially paid order
  is rejected. Repeating cancellation of a terminal item is an idempotent
  no-op for an owner or manager.

### PATCH `/api/orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/restore`
Restore a cancelled item (owner or manager only). The item returns to `pending`
and its recorded inventory deduction is applied again. The request fails when
the order is terminal, the order is paid, or available stock is insufficient.

### POST `/api/orders/:id/items`
Append items to an existing order.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

For a retry-safe append, send an `Idempotency-Key` header containing 1–128 printable, non-whitespace ASCII characters. Reuse the same key only for the same authenticated user's identical append request (order, items, and order notes) until its response is confirmed. A matching retry returns the original `200` response without adding items again, including if the order has since become non-editable; reusing the key for different data returns `409`.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": "prod-1",
      "quantity": 2,
      "addons": [{ "id": "addon-1", "quantity": 1 }],
      "special_instructions": "No onions"
    }
  ],
  "special_instructions": "Add drinks when ready"
}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "order": { "id": "order-1", "items": [ ... ] }
}
```

---

### PATCH `/api/order-items/:id/status`
Update item status (KDS workflow).

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "status": "preparing"
}
```

**Valid statuses:** `pending` → `preparing` → `ready` → `served`

---

## Order Discounts

### PATCH `/api/orders/:id/discount`
Apply order-level discount.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "discount_type": "percentage",
  "discount_value": 10,
  "discount_reason": "Happy hour"
}
```

**Validations:**
- `discount_type`: must be `"percentage"` or `"amount"`
- `discount_value`: must be positive; cannot exceed store limits (`discount_max_percentage`, `discount_max_amount`)
- `discount_mode` setting is checked — if `'flat'`, percentage discounts are rejected; if `'percentage'`, flat discounts are rejected
- If `discount_requires_approval` is true, `override_pin` (manager/owner PIN) is required
- Order must exist and not be completed/cancelled

**Error (400):**
```json
{ "error": "Percentage discounts are disabled" }
```

**Error (403) — approval required:**
```json
{ "error": "Manager PIN required for discounts", "requiresApproval": true }
```

---

### PATCH `/api/orders/:id/items/:itemId/discount`
Apply item-level discount.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json

  "discount_reason": "Comp item"
}
```

**Validations:** Same as order-level discount.

---

  "order_id": 1,
  "payment_method": "cash",
  "amount_tendered": 500
}
```

---

### PATCH `/api/bills/:id/pay`
Mark bill as paid.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "payment_method": "cash",
  "amount_tendered": 500
}
```

---

### POST `/api/bills/:id/applyDiscount`

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "type": "percentage",
  "value": 10,
  "reason": "Happy hour"
}
```

**Validations:**
- `type`: must be `"percentage"` or `"amount"`
- `value`: must be positive; cannot exceed store limits (`discount_max_percentage`, `discount_max_amount`)
- `discount_mode` setting is checked — restricts which discount types are allowed
- If `discount_requires_approval` is true, `override_pin` is required
- Recalculates tax on discounted subtotal
- Updates both bill and order in a transaction

**Error (400):**
```json
{ "error": "Discount exceeds maximum allowed" }
```

## Refund amount storage

`refunds.amount_cents` stores integer minor units for all refunds:
- For zero-decimal currencies (e.g. JPY, KRW), `amount_cents` stores whole currency units (factor 1).
- For standard two-decimal currencies (e.g. USD, EUR, INR), `amount_cents` stores cents (factor 100).
- For three-decimal currencies (e.g. KWD, BHD, OMR), `amount_cents` stores integer minor units (factor 1000).

Historical FloCafe databases operated exclusively under two-decimal currencies, where stored cents identically represent integer minor units (factor 100). Tenant business currency is configured during setup and governs store-wide order, billing, and settlement records; currency changes must not occur on active stores with open or unclosed financial periods. No database schema migration is required.

## Reports

Report date parameters use tenant business dates: each `YYYY-MM-DD` value is
interpreted in the store's configured timezone and business-day start time.
The default start time is `00:00`; a later configured start time assigns the
post-midnight interval before that time to the previous business date. Omitted
dates default to the tenant's current business date. Period fields expose the
corresponding UTC bounds where an endpoint returns them.

### GET `/api/reports/sales`
Daily/monthly sales report. Date query parameters use the tenant's configured
store timezone and business-day start time; see the report date convention
above.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Query params:** `?date=2025-03-31`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "date": "2025-03-31",
  "total_revenue": 15000,
  "order_count": 45,
  "avg_order_value": 333.33
}
```

---

### GET `/api/reports/financial-summary`
Owner-only collection summary and refund audit for a date range. Refunds are attributed to the original bill payment date so gross, refund, net, and payment-method totals reconcile for the selected period.

`start_date` and `end_date` use tenant business dates and are converted to UTC
ranges using the store timezone and configured business-day start time; see the
report date convention above.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <owner-token>`

**Query params:** `?start_date=2025-03-01&end_date=2025-03-31`

The response includes gross and net collections, refund totals and count, bill count, average order value, payment-method totals, and up to 50 most recent refunds affecting bills collected in the range.

---

### GET `/api/reports/x-report`

Live day report (cierre de caja, issue #649). Recomputes the day's aggregates on every read using the same snapshot pipeline that backs the stored Z, so the live X and the stored Z never drift apart. The opening float is **not** captured here — float is only recorded at close — so `expectedCashCents` is the cash-sales-only expectation (cash sales by `bills.paid_at` minus cash refunds by `refunds.created_at`), not the drawer expectation you'll see on the stored Z.

**Role:** owner, manager

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <owner-or-manager-token>`

**Query params:** `?date=YYYY-MM-DD` — tenant business date (defaults to the current business date; see the report date convention above)

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "xReport": {
    "businessDate": "2025-03-31",
    "periodStart": "2025-03-30 18:30:00",
    "periodEnd": "2025-03-31 18:30:00",
    "grossCollected": 15000,
    "refunded": 250,
    "netCollected": 14750,
    "billCount": 45,
    "refundCount": 2,
    "paymentMethods": [
      { "method": "cash", "count": 30, "total": 9000 },
      { "method": "card", "count": 15, "total": 6000 }
    ],
    "staffSales": [
      { "user_id": "chef-1", "name": "Chef One", "role": "chef", "revenue": 8000, "orderCount": 22 }
    ],
    "taxComponents": [
      { "title": "CGST", "amount": 187.5, "rate": 0.025 }
    ],
    "expectedCashCents": 875000,
    "alreadyClosed": false
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `grossCollected`, `refunded`, `netCollected`, `paymentMethods[].total`, `staffSales[].revenue`, `taxComponents[].amount` | number | **Display major units** (minor-factor-divided; matches `financial-summary` / tax-components). |
| `expectedCashCents` | integer | **INTEGER cents.** Cash sales by `bills.paid_at` minus cash refunds by `refunds.created_at`. Excludes the opening float. The consuming client must convert any counted-cash input to cents before comparing. |
| `businessDate` / `periodStart` / `periodEnd` | string | `businessDate` is a tenant business date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). `periodStart` and `periodEnd` are UTC bounds of that business date's configured 24-hour period, formatted `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (space-separated, no `T`, no `Z`, no millis — produced by `dayBoundsInTimezone()` and matching the SQLite `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` family). |
| `alreadyClosed` | boolean | `true` when a `cash_closures` row exists for the day. |
| `priorClosedCashCents` | integer \| null | INTEGER cents counted-cash from the most recent prior `scope='day'` `cash_closures` row (used to default the next day's opening float). `null` when no prior day close exists. |
| `priorBusinessDate` | string \| null | `business_date` of that prior close (`YYYY-MM-DD`). `null` when no prior day close exists. |
| `zNumber` | integer \| absent | Field is **omitted from the JSON** while `alreadyClosed` is `false`; present and an integer once the day is closed. |

The per-method `count` is the row count in the UNION'd `paymentMethodBreakdown` view (paid payment lines **plus** refund lines as negative-amount rows — paymentMethodBreakdown UNION semantics, same as `financial-summary`). UI labels that derive "N payments" from these counts therefore include the day's refund lines in the total; use `refundCount` to subtract.

The canonical "cash" identity is the literal `method === 'cash'` filter — custom payment-method names are not joined into the cash-only expected figure.

**Convention — paid bills survive cancellation.** A paid bill counts toward the day's aggregates (`paymentMethods`, `taxComponents`, `grossCollected`, `staffSales`) even when its order is later cancelled: the cash left in the drawer is real, and the X uses the same aggregator the Z uses at close. Note this is **broader** than the live `/api/reports/tax-components` endpoint, which excludes cancelled orders (`main/routes/reports.ts:255-262`); the X intentionally follows the Z's drawer-reality convention so the live and stored views of the same day agree. Refunds recorded against a paid bill reverse the cash via the refunds UNION in `paymentMethodBreakdown`.

**Convention — staff and tax sections follow the paid day.** The X and Z key `staffSales` and `taxComponents` by `b.paid_at` (the day cash was collected) so every section of the immutable Z reconciles to the same window as `grossCollected`, `paymentMethods`, and `expectedCashCents`. On a cross-midnight day (order created Day 1, paid Day 2), staff revenue and tax components land in Day 2's snapshot. This **differs** from `/api/reports/insights` (`topStaff`, keyed by `orders.created_at`) and `/api/reports/tax-components` (keyed by `bills.created_at`) on cross-midnight days; the divergence is intentional — the Z must be internally reconcilable, while those live views prioritize the order's creation day. `staffSales[].orderCount` counts paid bills (not orders), so split checks multiply it; `/api/reports/insights` `topStaff.orderCount` counts orders instead.

### GET `/api/reports/z-report`

Stored day-close snapshot. Reads the immutable `cash_closures` row for the requested business date. The stored Z is the closed day's authoritative figure — late refunds against a closed day keep their existing live-report behaviour but never rewrite the row. No reopen endpoint exists in v1; corrections are operator notes, not mutations.

**Role:** owner, manager

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <owner-or-manager-token>`

**Query params:** `?date=YYYY-MM-DD` — tenant business date (defaults to the current business date; see the report date convention above)

**Response (200):**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| All `*_cents` fields | integer | **INTEGER cents.** `expected_cash_cents` includes the opening float: `expected = opening_float + cash_sales − cash_refunds(created_at)`. The same-day X and Z expected values therefore differ by exactly `opening_float_cents` — consumers must not compare them directly. |
| `payment_methods[].total_cents`, `staff_sales[].revenue_cents` | integer | INTEGER cents (storage shape; converted to display major units at the X read edge). |
| `tax_components[].amount` | number | **Display major units** — identical to the X response's `taxComponents`, not cents. The Z stores the same `aggregateTaxComponents` output verbatim and serves it without conversion. |
| `variance_cents` | integer | `counted_cash_cents − expected_cash_cents`. May be negative. |
| `z_number` | integer | Monotonic, allocated from `nextZNumber()` at close time. |
| `closed_by` | string | `users.id` of the operator who closed. |
| `closed_by_name` | string | Display name of that operator (`users.name`), with `closed_by` used as fallback when the user row is missing. Resolved server-side on read for the Z JSON and on print for the receipt body. |
| `notes` | string \| null | Free-form operator notes from the close request, or `null` if none were provided. |
| `created_at` | string | UTC close timestamp, formatted `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (space-separated, no `T`, no `Z`, no millis — matches `db.now()` and SQLite `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`). |
| `business_date` / `period_start` / `period_end` | string | `business_date` is a tenant business date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). `period_start` and `period_end` are UTC bounds of that business date's configured 24-hour period, formatted `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (space-separated, no `T`, no `Z`, no millis — produced by `dayBoundsInTimezone()` and matching the SQLite `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` family). |

**Error (404):** the day is not yet closed.
```json
{ "error": "Day not closed", "alreadyClosed": false, "businessDate": "2025-03-31" }

## Cash Closures

### POST `/api/cash-closures`

Close the current tenant business day (cierre de caja, issue #649). One close per business date per store. The backend recomputes every aggregate server-side — it never trusts client totals — and stores one immutable row in `cash_closures` inside a single transaction. The stored Z is the closed day's authoritative figure; no reopen endpoint exists in v1.

**Role:** owner (manager / cashier / server → 403)

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <owner-token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "business_date": "2025-03-31",
  "opening_float_cents": 50000,
  "counted_cash_cents": 925000,
  "notes": "Late drawer count"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `business_date` | string | Tenant business date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Must be a real calendar date (regex match is not enough — `2026-02-30` is rejected). Not in the future relative to the current tenant business date. |
| `opening_float_cents` | integer | INTEGER cents, `>= 0`. Cash float the operator is starting the day with. |
| `counted_cash_cents` | integer | INTEGER cents, `>= 0`. Cash the operator counted in the drawer at close. |
| `notes` | string \| optional | Free-form notes, ≤ 500 characters. |

Snapshot math (verbatim from spec):
```
expected_cash_cents = opening_float_cents
                    + cash_sales_cents
                    − cash_refunds_by_created_at_cents
variance_cents      = counted_cash_cents − expected_cash_cents
```

The canonical "cash" identity is the literal `method === 'cash'` filter — custom payment-method names are not joined into the cash-only expected figure. Refunds are attributed by `refunds.created_at` for the drawer-reality split; display totals attribute refunds to the original bill's `paid_at` (matching `financial-summary`).

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "zReport": {
    "id": 17,
    "scope": "day",
    "business_date": "2025-03-31",
    "period_start": "2025-03-30 18:30:00",
    "period_end": "2025-03-31 18:30:00",
    "opening_float_cents": 50000,
    "expected_cash_cents": 925000,
    "counted_cash_cents": 925000,
    "variance_cents": 0,
    "gross_collected_cents": 1500000,
    "refunded_cents": 25000,
    "net_collected_cents": 1475000,
    "bill_count": 45,
    "refund_count": 2,
    "payment_methods": [
      { "method": "cash", "count": 30, "total_cents": 900000 },
      { "method": "card", "count": 15, "total_cents": 600000 }
    ],
    "staff_sales": [
      { "user_id": "chef-1", "name": "Chef One", "role": "chef", "revenue_cents": 800000, "orderCount": 22 }
    ],
    "tax_components": [
      { "title": "CGST", "amount": 187.5, "rate": 0.025 }
    ],
    "z_number": 17,
    "closed_by": "owner-1",
    "notes": "Late drawer count",
    "created_at": "2025-04-01 01:23:45"
  }
}
```

The response field shape matches `GET /api/reports/z-report` except it omits `closed_by_name`, which is resolved server-side on the Z read — the stored row is the source of truth for both reads.

**Error (400):** malformed body, non-integer / negative cents, future date, notes too long, or invalid calendar date. The `error` message names the offending field, e.g. `business_date is not a real calendar date`, `counted_cash_cents must be >= 0`, `notes is too long`.

**Error (409):** the day is already closed (duplicate `POST` against the same `business_date`).
```json
{ "error": "This day is already closed" }
```
A concurrent winner of a double-`POST` race still returns 409 — the partial unique index `cash_closures_one_day ... WHERE scope = 'day'` is the safety net behind the SELECT-then-INSERT.

---

### POST `/api/cash-closures/:id/print`

Dispatch the stored Z to the default receipt printer. The forced drawer pulse is appended server-side (bypassing bill-bound `shouldPulseForPayment`, which can never fire for a bill-less Z) and is **not** filtered through `cash_drawer_pulse_methods`: the Z is the document the merchant prints while counting the drawer. The stored row is never mutated by printing.

**Role:** owner (manager / cashier / server → 403)

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <owner-token>`

**Path params:** `:id` — positive integer, the `cash_closures.id` returned by `POST /api/cash-closures` or `GET /api/reports/z-report`.

**Request:**
```json
{ "isReprint": false }
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `isReprint` | boolean \| optional | When `true`, the printed body shows a `REPRINT` marker next to the Z number. Defaults to `false`. |

The route resolves the default receipt printer server-side (the WebUSB branch is reachable end-to-end this way; helpers that exclude WebUSB would otherwise skip it). Labels use the independently configured `z_report_language_policy`, which defaults to the store language and supports one additional language.

**Response (200, WebUSB):** the renderer dispatches the bytes itself.
```json
{ "success": true, "webusb": true, "isReprint": false, "bytes": [27, 64, 27, 112, 0, 25, 250], "warnings": [] }
```

**Response (200, network / USB):**
```json
{ "success": true, "isReprint": false, "warnings": [] }
```

**Error (400):** invalid id.
```json
{ "error": "id must be a positive integer" }
```

**Error (404):** no row for that id.
```json
{ "error": "Cash closure not found" }
```

**Error (409):** no default printer is configured.
```json
{ "error": "No default printer configured" }
```

**Error (502):** the printer did not respond or the dispatch failed.
```json
{ "error": "<detail>", "detail": "<detail>", "warnings": [] }
```

Unsupported text in a financial Z-report unit fails closed before dispatch and
returns a financial warning in the 502 response. Non-financial skipped text is
reported in `warnings` without claiming that it printed.

Printed Z layout, in spec order: header (business name, address, tax id — **branch omitted: no branch data source exists in the schema**) → Z number + business date + period start/end → opening float → sales by payment method → refunds → tax breakdown → staff sales → expected / counted / variance (variance emphasized) → operator + signature line → footer. The forced drawer pulse is appended after the footer.

## Settings

### GET `/api/settings/business`
Get business settings. Locale display preferences (`currency_display`, `number_digits`, `calendar`) are resolved against the active country's declared `localeOptions`; stale or unsupported stored values are normalized to neutral defaults.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "business_name": "My Restaurant",
  "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata",
  "business_day_start_time": "00:00",
  "currency": "INR",
  "country": "IN",
  "tax_registration_number": "22AAAAA0000A1Z5",
  "currency_display": "rial",
  "number_digits": "locale",
  "calendar": "locale"
}
```

---

### PUT `/api/settings/business`
Update business settings.

`timezone` is validated as an IANA identifier; invalid values return HTTP 400 with `"Invalid timezone, currency, or country"`.

`business_day_start_time` configures the local start of the 24-hour business
period used by reports and cash closures. It is returned as `HH:mm`, defaults
to `00:00`, and is trimmed before persistence; invalid values return HTTP 400.

`currency` accepts any three-letter ASCII currency code. Leading/trailing
whitespace is trimmed and lowercase input is normalized to uppercase before
the value is persisted; invalid codes return the same HTTP 400 response.

When `tax_registration_number` is provided, the backend validates it against the active country pack's registration format. A mismatch returns HTTP 400:

```json
{
  "error": "Tax ID does not match the expected IN format: 15-digit GSTIN",
  "tax_id_format": { "pattern": "...", "description": "..." }
}
```

Locale display preferences (`currency_display`, `number_digits`, `calendar`) are validated against the effective country's `localeOptions`. Unsupported values return HTTP 400 with `"Invalid <key> for country <code>"`. Changing the country normalizes any previously stored preferences that are not supported by the new country to their neutral defaults (`rial`, `locale`, `locale`).

---

### GET `/api/settings/tax`
Get tax settings.

---

### PUT `/api/settings/tax`
Update tax settings (owner/manager only).

Validates `tax_registration_number` against the active country pack format, same as `PUT /api/settings/business`.

---

### GET `/api/settings/discount`
Get discount limits configuration.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "discount_max_percentage": 50,
  "discount_max_amount": 100,
  "discount_mode": "both",
  "discount_requires_approval": false
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `discount_max_percentage` | number | Max % for percentage discounts (0 = no limit) |
| `discount_max_amount` | number | Max flat amount for discounts (0 = no limit) |
| `discount_mode` | string | `'percentage'`, `'flat'`, or `'both'` — which discount types are allowed |
| `discount_requires_approval` | boolean | Require manager PIN to apply discounts |

---

### PUT `/api/settings/discount`
Update discount limits (owner/manager only).

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "discount_max_percentage": 30,
  "discount_max_amount": 200,
  "discount_mode": "both",
  "discount_requires_approval": true
}
```

**Validation:**
- `discount_max_percentage`: float, range 0–100 (0 = no limit)
- `discount_max_amount`: float, range 0–999999 (0 = no limit)
- `discount_mode`: must be `'percentage'`, `'flat'`, or `'both'`
- `discount_requires_approval`: boolean

**Error (400):**
```json
{ "error": "discount_mode must be \"percentage\", \"flat\", or \"both\"" }
```

## Printers

Printer configuration is available to owners and managers. Receipt and KOT print endpoints also allow cashiers. See [Printer setup](printers.md) for the operational guide.

### GET `/api/printers`

List configured printers, with their resolved printer profile.

### GET `/api/printers/detect`

Detect available USB and network printers.

### GET `/api/printers/supported`

List FloCafe's known printer profiles.

### GET `/api/printers/:id`

Get one configured printer.

### POST `/api/printers`

Create a printer. `connection_type` must be `network`, `usb`, or `webusb`. Network printers require `ip_address`.

```json
{
  "name": "Kitchen Printer",
  "connection_type": "network",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "port": 9100,
  "paper_width": "80mm",
  "cash_drawer_pulse_enabled": false,
  "is_default": true
}
```

A WebUSB entry stores the paper-width preference; the browser selects the physical device.

### PUT `/api/printers/:id`

Update printer configuration. The request accepts the same fields as creation.

### DELETE `/api/printers/:id`

Delete a configured printer.

### POST `/api/printers/:id/set-default`

Make a printer the default for regular receipt printing.

### POST `/api/printers/:id/test`

Send a test page. The printed timestamp uses the tenant's configured store
timezone. Pass `{ "rasterProbe": true }` to request the capability-gated
raster diagnostic bands; profiles without enabled raster capability retain the
standard test page. For WebUSB, the response contains the ESC/POS bytes for the
browser to send.

### POST `/api/printers/print-bill`

Print the bill identified by `billId` or the bill associated with `orderId`.

```json
{
  "billId": 123,
  "useUnicode": false,
  "isReprint": false,
  "preview": false,
  "arabicShaping": false
}
```

Pass `preview: true` to generate receipt preview text, base64 ESC/POS payload, and column metrics without dispatching to a physical printer. If no hardware printer is configured, preview mode falls back to default 80 mm formatting.

Successful print responses include `{ "success": true, "warnings": [] }`. If
receipt preparation finds unsupported financial text, the endpoint returns HTTP
502 before transport with `stage: "prepare"`, `failure_class: "unsupported"`,
and the financial warnings in `warnings`; dispatch failures use
`stage: "dispatch"`. See [printing architecture warning semantics](printing-architecture.md#6-printer-capability-model--warning-semantics) for the warning contract.

### POST `/api/printers/print-kot`

Print a kitchen order ticket for `orderId`. A caller may provide `stationName` and `items`; otherwise FloCafe routes items to configured kitchen stations. The KOT status-filtering contract is defined in [printing architecture](printing-architecture.md#3-printdocument-v1-model). This endpoint returns `403` when KOT printing is disabled.

```json
{
  "orderId": 123,
  "useUnicode": false,
  "arabicShaping": false
}
```

## Merchant Print Templates

Owner-role CRUD for tenant-owned semantic receipt templates (#447). See
[Merchant print templates](merchant-print-templates.md) for the payload schema, validation policy,
provenance/trust model, and offline transfer contract. Payloads are validated
fail-closed on every write.

### GET `/api/print-templates`
List merchant templates (all statuses). Owner or manager.

### POST `/api/print-templates`
Create a template in `draft` status. Body: `{ name, payload, origin?, derivedFrom? }`.
`origin` is one of `created | imported | cloned`; `cloned` requires a
`derivedFrom` reference `{ type: 'compliance-pack-template' | 'merchant-template' | 'offline-import', templateId }`
(informational only — no compliance trust transfers).

### PUT `/api/print-templates/:id`
Update name and/or payload. Editing an ACTIVE template snapshots its current
payload into the single-step rollback point. Archived templates are immutable.

### POST `/api/print-templates/:id/activate`
Promote to `active`. Fails closed (409) if the stored checksum does not match
the payload.

### POST `/api/print-templates/:id/archive`
Terminal state; archived templates stop being selectable.

### POST `/api/print-templates/:id/rollback`
Restore `previous_payload_json` after verifying the current checksum; clears
the rollback point. 409 when there is nothing to roll back to, when the
restored payload fails current validation, or when the template is archived.

### GET `/api/print-templates/:id/payload`
Read the stored payload (owner or manager).

### GET `/api/print-templates/:id/export`
Download an active or archived template as a portable
`*.flocafe-template.json` envelope. Owner only. Drafts and rows with invalid
stored checksums are rejected; the response is JSON with an attachment
filename.

### POST `/api/print-templates/import`
Import a portable envelope as a new `draft`. Owner only. Body:
`{ file, name?, fileName? }`, where `file` is the raw envelope JSON text and
`fileName` is the optional source filename recorded in offline-import
provenance. The import path enforces the envelope and payload validators,
checksum verification, and the 256 KB raw-byte cap; it never activates or
overwrites an existing template.

---

## Mobile Pairing

### GET `/api/mobile/pairing-code`
Get current pairing code.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "pairing_code": "123456",
  "rotated_at": "2025-03-31T10:00:00Z"
}
```

---

### POST `/api/mobile/rotate-code`
Generate new pairing code.

---

## KDS Info

### GET `/api/kds-info`
Get KDS access URLs and QR code.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "mdns_url": "http://flo.local:3001/kds",
  "ip_url": "http://192.168.1.50:3001/kds",
  "qr_url": "http://192.168.1.50:3001/kds",
  "qr_data_url": "data:image/png;base64,..."
}
```

---

## WebSocket Events Summary

| Event | Direction | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `auth` | → Server | Authenticate with JWT token |
| `auth_success` | ← Server | Authentication successful |
| `auth_error` | ← Server | Authentication failed |
| `initial_data` | ← Server | Initial orders and counts |
| `new_order` | ← Server | New order created |
| `order_updated` | ← Server | Order status changed |
| `status_update` | → Server | Update item status |
| `orders` | ← Server | Full orders list (periodic) |

---

## Order Status Flow

The order-level transition matrix is documented with
`PATCH /api/orders/:id/status` above. The KDS item progression is
`pending` → `preparing` → `ready` → `served`; cancellation and void statuses
are documented in the Order Items section.

Each item in an order has its own status, allowing:
- Multiple items in one order
- Different items at different stages
- KDS shows items filtered by status

---

## Role-Based Access

See [Roles and permissions](roles-and-permissions.md) for the complete current role matrix. The database accepts `owner`, `manager`, `cashier`, `server`, and `chef`; the historical `waiter` label is no longer a valid role.

---

## Category Filtering (KDS)

Users with `chef` role have `category_ids` array. When accessing KDS:
1. Server validates JWT token
2. Server checks role is `chef`, `manager`, or `owner`
3. Server filters order items to only show products in user's categories
4. One user can have multiple categories

Example: Chef1 (cat-1, cat-2) only sees Food and Beverages items.
